# Xiaomi BLE Temperature Display for Home Assistant
## Introduction
I have developed this project to integrate the Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC LCD temperature and Humidity display with Home Assistant.

</p>

The display outputs Temperature, Humidity and Battery level using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This means we need some sort of hub to collect the data and render it in a way that Home Assistant understands. I chose to use a Raspberry Pi W for this job as it has built-in support for BLE. MQTT is an efficient way for remote devices to communicate with Home Assistant, so I added suport for this.
## Building The Solution
* The first thing you need to do is to get the latest version of Raspbian running on your Pi W. You can find out how to do that here https://all4pi.com/uncategorized/headless-raspberry-pi-setup-in-twenty-minutes/
* Now copy the files:
  * blemqtt.sh
  * ble_scan_example.py
  * LYWSD03MMC.py
  to the /home/pi folder  
* LYWSD03MMC.py is the main script that does all the work. It was taken from https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2
  All I have done is added a few lines to output the data to MQTT. The only change you need to make is 
  ```
  hostname = "192.168.0.99"   # address of MQTT server
  ```
  where you must enter the name, or IP address of your MQTT server.
  
  You will also need to install bluepy https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy using
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev
  $ sudo pip3 install bluepy
'''
* ble_scan_example.py is from https://gist.github.com/bgloh/3c7dd0c754a0b596e8ef6225199adc1e. I have reproduced here, unchanged. You will need to run this to discover the address of your device
  run
```
sudo python3 ble_scan_example.py
```
  and you should see something like
```
pi@blemqtt:~ $ sudo python3 ble_scan_example.py

```
This shows the addresses of two LYWSD03MMC devices as a4:c1:38:47:63:36 and a4:c1:38:cf:bc:2f
* now edit blemqtt.sh and change the addresses to match the ones you have just discovered
```
#!/bin/bash
# continuously loops around devices
for (( ; ; ))
do
    # for first device
    /home/pi/LYWSD03MMC.py -d a4:c1:38:cf:bc:2f -r -b 5 -c 1
    sleep 60s
    
    #second device
    /home/pi/LYWSD03MMC.py -d a4:c1:38:47:63:36 -r -b 5 -c 1
    sleep 60s
    
    #etc
done

```  
  NOTE: the ```-c 1``` switch means that the LYWSD03MMC.py script will run once then exit.
  
  You will probably need to use chmod to make the script executable```
``` 
sudo chmod 777 blemqtt.sh
```
now try
```
./blemqtt.sh
```
  if all is well you should see an output like this
```

Trying to connect to a4:c1:38:cf:bc:2f

1 measurements collected. Exiting in a moment.

```
* to test the MQTT output we can use Home Assistant
 Just open up Developer Tools and go to the MQTT tab
 enter blemqtt/# next to **Listening to** under the **Listen to a topic** tab and click on **START LISTENING**
 
 <p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="resources/blemqtt listen.png">
</p>
 
You should see an output like the one above.
* next step is make it run automatically. For this we use a Systemd service
  copy blemqtt.service to /etc/systemd/system. If you used my setup guide, you can do this straight from you windows desktop.
* Run
```
sudo systemctl enable blemqtt
sudo systemctl start blemqtt
```
  If you repeat the step where you listen for the topic in Home Assistant, you should see the values coming through.
* Now we are going to create the sensors in Home assistant. You will need to edit your onfiguration.yaml. I use the Configurator Add-on.
Add in these entries:
```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature_x1"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138476336"
    unit_of_measurement: '°C'
    device_class: "temperature"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
    
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Humidity_x1"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138476336"
    device_class: "humidity"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
     
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Battery_x1"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138476336"
    device_class: "battery"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.batt }}"
     
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature_x2"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138cfbc2f"
    unit_of_measurement: '°C'
    device_class: "temperature"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
    
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Humidity_x2"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138cfbc2f"
    device_class: "humidity"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
     
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Battery_x2"
    state_topic: "blemqtt/a4c138cfbc2f"
    device_class: "battery"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.batt }}"
```
  If you already have a sensor: tag then add these underneath it. If you duplicate it, you will get an error.
  In order to make these changes live you will have to restart Home Assistant. The easiest way is to do this is to go into **Developer Tools** and select the **SERVICES** tab. Select the **homeassistant.restart** Service and click on **CALL SERVICE**.
  You will get the **Connection lost. Reconnecting...** message for a while.
  
  * once this is finished we can have a look at our values.
  In the **Overview** go into edit mode by clicking on the three little vertical dots in the top right of the page. Then select **Configure UI**.
  In the bottonm right, click on the **+** button to make a new card. Select **Glance**. In the card, click on **SHOW CODE EDITOR**, and copy in the following code
 ```
entities:
  - entity: sensor.temperature_x1
    name: Temperature
  - entity: sensor.humidity_x1
    name: Humidity
  - entity: sensor.battery_x1
    name: Battery
title: Xiaomi Display 1
type: glance
```
Repeat this for display 2 using _x2_ instead of _x1_
If all is well you should see something like this:
